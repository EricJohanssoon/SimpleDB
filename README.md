# ðŸ’¾ SimpleDB

Created a basic database management system called SimpleDB. This project was part of a course in Database Management System Implementation at Eurecom in 2021/2022. We have implemented the core modules required to access stored data on disk as well as added support for various query processing operators.

This project is developed by me (Eric Johansson) and goonser (Carl-Johan BjÃ¶rnsson)
